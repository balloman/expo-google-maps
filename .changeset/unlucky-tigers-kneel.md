Added android support!

Android should have all the support iOS has which includes
- Map Display
  - Android has a different method of supplying the api key, so now it will need to be provided with an expo plugin
- Markers
  - Support for custom views is here as well, but it might be a little buggy on the android side, so let me know if you encounter any issues
- Polygons
